# Exercise 1: Setup your toolchain and a new Angular 2 project

# a.

    Install code editor (+ extensions), git, npm and angular-cli
    Use angular-cli to generate the app skeleton (set style type to scss. Look for word 'style').
    Test that app works, run with angular-cli and open in browser
    Use link from Oma assignments to create a remote git repository and push your app there

# b.

    develop your app further. Add parts to the app skeleton so that the layout is similar to this
    git add, commit & push to remote repository
    goto b 1 and add content (text, images) and more CSS.
